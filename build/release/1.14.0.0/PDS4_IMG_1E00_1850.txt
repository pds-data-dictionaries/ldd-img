   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The bandwidth attribute provides a measure of the spectral width of a filter. For a root-mean-square detector this is the effective bandwidth of the filter, i.e. the full width of an ideal square filter having a flat response over the bandwidth and zero response elsewhere. Another common method for measuring bandwidth is Full Width at Half Maximum, which is the width of a "bump" on a curve or function. It is given by the distance between points on the curve at which the function reaches half of its maximum value.

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The color_dn_scaling_method attribute defines how the color values are scaled. EXPOSURE_NORMALIZED_COLOR means that the color values have been normalized based on exposure time, so neighboring images in a mosaic will have the same color values. DN_COLOR means that the color values are based on the raw DNs, so images take full advantage of the available dynamic range but may not match with neighbors in a mosaic.

   name                   color_filter_array_state
   version                1.14

   description            Defines the type of Color Filter Array (CFA) used to encode multiple colors in a single exposure. The most common example of this is the Bayer pattern. This is optional if there is no CFA. Additional attributes, specific to each CFA type, define whether or not the CFA pattern has been removed, and if so, how (e.g. bayer_algorithm).

   name                   color_space
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Defines the color space in which this product is expressed. Some color spaces (e.g. XYZ or xyY) are independent of illuminant, while for others (e.g. sRGB or pRGB) the illuminant matters. It is expected that the defined color spaces will increase over time.

   name                   color_subsampling_mode
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The color_subsampling_mode attribute specifies the JPEG color subsampling mode used during compression. Valid values: '4:2:2' - 4:2:2 chroma subsampling, which is the typical case, '4:4:4' - 4:4:4 chroma sampling, which indicates no subsampling, 'Grayscale' - indicates a grayscale image

   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The input_dn_max attribute provides the value of the maximum DN in the input image that is assigned a specific DN in the output image during companding.

   name                   input_dn_min
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The input_dn_min attribute provides the value of the minimum DN in the input image that is assigned a specific DN in the output image during companding.

   name                   output_dn

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The sample_bit_mask attribute Specifies the active bits in a sample. Any bit mask is valid in an non-raw product. Any 8-bit product, whether a scaled raw product or other, will have the value "2#11111111" and be stored in one byte. Any 12-bit product, whether an unscaled raw product, or an ILUT partially-processed product (see companding_method), will have the value "2#0000111111111111" and be stored in two bytes. A 15-bit product (e.g. Radiometrically-corrected Calibrated product type) will have the value "2#0111111111111111" and be stored in two bytes. Any 32-bit integer product (e.g. Histogram Raw product) will have the value "2#11111111111111111111111111111111" and be stored in four bytes. For floating-point data, sample_bit_mask is not valid and may be absent. If present, it should be ignored. NOTE: In the PDS, the domain of sample_bit_mask is dependent upon the currently-described value in the sample_bits attribute and only applies to unsigned integer values. Thus sample_bit_mask is not allowed for signed or floating-point types.

   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The sample_bits attribute specifies the logical or active number of bits in the data, which is distinct from the physical number of bits (for example, encoding 12-bit data within 16-bit words). These logical bits are stored in the low order (least significant) bits, with unused bits filled with 0 (or 1 for negative integers to preserve a two's complement representation). This is distinct from the valid data range (specified by valid_minimum and valid_maximum in Special_Constants class) because all values, including missing/invalid flag values, must fit within the sample_bits. The intent is that the data should be able to be sent through a communication channel that passes only sample_bits with no loss in fidelity.

   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description             The segment_quality attribute identifies the resultant or targeted image quality index for on-board ICER data compression. Upon return by the ICER decompress function, the output quantity segment_quality provides an indication of the quality of the reconstructed segment. Specifically, the value returned is a double for which the integer values correspond to attained min loss values, but in general is an interpolation between these values. Thus lower values of segment_quality correspond to higher reconstructed qualities, and a value of indicates lossless compression. Note that the compressed stream does not directly contain the value of min loss that was given to the compressor, but the decompressor does know how far along in the decompression process it got before it ran out of bits; this information is used to determine segment_quality. In rare circumstances the decompressor m ay not be able to determine segment_quality for a segment that it decompresses. In this case it sets segment_quality to 1.0. The reconstructed segment might be either lossy or lossless when this occurs. The technical condition under which a quality value is not determined is that the decompressor runs out of the data for the segment before decoding any bit plane information. 

   name                   segment_status
   version                1.14
   value data type        ASCII_Numeric_Base2
   description             The segment_status attribute provides a bit mask which provides the status of decoding for the compression segment identified by segment_number. Upon return by the ICER decompress function, the output quantity of segment_status contains a number indicating the decode status. The decode status may have one or more of the following flags set: SHORTDATASEG FLAG (bit 0): If this flag is set, then the segment contained so little data that nothing could be reconstructed in the segment. INCONSISTENTDATA FLAG (bit 1): If this flag is set, then one or more pieces of information in the segment header (specifically, image width, image height, n segs, wavelet filter, n decomps) are inconsistent with the value(s) in the first (valid) segment. ICER will ignore the data in this segment. DUPLICATESEG FLAG (bit 2): If this flag is set, then the segment index given in the header equals that given by a previous segment. The decompressor will ignore the data in this segment. BADBITPLANENUMBER FLAG (bit 3): If this flag is set, then an ICER internal parameter in the header for this segment has probably been corrupted. The decompressor will ignore the data in this segment. BADBITPLANECOUNT FLAG (bit 4): If this flag is set, then an ICER internal parameter in the header for this segment has probably been corrupted. The decompressor will ignore the data in this segment. BADDATA FLAG (bit 5): If this flag is set, then either the parameter combination given in the header for this segment are not allowed by ICER, or the segment number is bad. This probably indicates corrupted data. The decompressor will ignore the data in this segment.

   name                   Autoexposure
   description            The Autoexposure class contains attributes used to identify or describe the algorithm used to automatically calculate the proper exposure time. This is generally based on some kind of histogram analysis. The specific autoexposure algorithm used is defined in the processing_algorithm attribute, and the specific set of attributes needed to describe it will vary based on the algorithm. Examples of autoexposure algorithms include "Maki 2003" used on MER, MSL ECAMs, M2020 ECAMS; "Maurice 2012" used on MSL ChemCam; "Smith 1997" used on Mars Pathfinder Imager.

   name                   Brightness_Correction
   description            The Brightness_Correction class describes brightness corrections that were applied to an image or mosaic. Brightness correction is the process of adjusting the DN values of adjacent frames in a mosaic so they match visually. It may also involve contrast or vignetting adjustments. The result may no longer be radiometrically calibrated due to the adjustments. The processing_algorithm child of Brightness_Correction describes the type of brightness correction, and should correspond to the classes within Brightness_Correction_Image. If the algorithm is "MIXED", multiple algorithms were used, in which case the specific information in each Brightness_Correction_Image must be used.

   name                   Color_Filter_Array
   description            The Color_Filter_Array class describes whether or not an image was acquired using a Color Filter Array (CFA) and if so, whether and how the CFA pattern was removed. A CFA is a method for making color images using one exposure on a single sensor plane, where microfilters of different wavelengths are put in front of pixels in a specific pattern. The most common pattern is the Bayer pattern, which has a red, blue, and two green pixels in every 2x2 pixel square. Although generally used for RGB color, CFA filters can be of any number and wavelength (see color_filter_array_type).

   name                   Companding
   description             The Companding class describes whether or not data is or has had its bit depth reduced (for example conversion from 12 to 8 bits via a lookup table or bit scaling), the venue where it occurred (Software or Hardware), and the method used to complete the companding. The processing_algorithm attribute specifies how data was companded. Generally this will either be via a lookup table (such as a square root encoding), or by shifting bits to preserve the high order bits and discard the low order bits. The value of this keyword is mission specific but there are recommended values that should apply across missions when possible: NONE - no scaling. LUTn - use the numbered lookup table. Lookup tables are defined in the mission SIS. It is preferred for "n" to be a number but it could be a name, for example LUT_MMM_3 to indicate LUT 3 for the MMM instruments (on MSL). MSB_BITn - Shift to make bit "n" the most significant. Bits start numbering at 0 so MSB_BIT7 means no shift for a 12->8 bit companding, while MSB_BIT11 means to shift right 4 bits for a 12->8 bit companding. AUTOSHIFT - Data should be shifted to preserve the highest value. This value should only appear in a command echo; one of the MSB_BITn values should be used in downlinked data to specify what the actual shift was.

   name                   Downsampling
   description             The Downsampling class describes whether or not downsampling occurred, the venue where it occurred (Software or Hardware), the method used to downsample, and the pixel averaging dimensions. A downsampled image is a smaller version of the image, resulting in reduced resolution of the same coverage area. The processing_algorithm attribute specifies the pixel resolution downsample method used. This varies by mission, but examples from MSL include: 'Mean' - Downsampling done in software by calculation of the mean., 'Conditional' - Use hardware binning if downsampling (by mean calculation) and subframe arguments are consistent.

   name                   Onboard_Color_Matrix
   description            The Onboard_Color_Matrix class represents a 3x3 matrix that is used onboard to perform color correction. It is done after de-Bayering, as all three color bands are needed for each pixel. The first three elements are multiplied by the R,G,B (respectively) pixel values and summed to get the output Red pixel value. Similarly, the second three create the output Green, and the last three the output Blue. If the label is not present, no correction was performed.

   description            The Onboard_Responsivity class specifies factors that have been applied to the R, G, and B cells (respectively) of the Bayer pattern, before de-Bayering (demosaicking) takes place. The intent of these is to approximately balance the filters so the de-Bayering process is not skewed, and EDR/ILT products look reasonable before full radiometric or color correction is done on the ground. If these factors are not present, no correction was performed.

   name                   Tile
   description            Contains parameters that describe how an image was or will be broken into tiles, before reassembly into a whole. This is generally intended for cameras that break up an exposure into tiles for transmission, but can also be used to describe tiling done by a ground system (e.g. for display purposes) if needed. Tiles need not be regular nor do they need to cover the entire area, and irregular tiles may overlap. Note that the image in which this class appears is expected to contain all the tiles (i.e. not just a single tile).
