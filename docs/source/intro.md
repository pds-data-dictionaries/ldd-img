The Imaging (IMG, namespace img:) data dictionary is intended as a one-stop shopping place for information about an image.  This includes information about the camera acquiring the image, the state of the 
camera at acquisition, properties of the image, and processing that has been applied to the image.  The IMG data dictionary is a menu of possibilities, and the intent is for data providers to pick the items 
that they want to use for their camera, and leave the rest off.  Usually, the choices you make will come down to what metadata you have available for your camera and images.  
For example, you may have one attribute from IMG in your label, or hundreds â€“ either way, the IMG data dictionary can work to meet your needs.
Questions about this dictionary can be directed to the Imaging Node at pds-imaging@jpl.nasa.gov
